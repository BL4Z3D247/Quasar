Generate at least three logo variations initially: an icon-only version, a wordmark version, and a combined version of the logo.

1. Icon-only version: This version should focus on a standalone symbol or icon that represents the brand essence. It should be simple yet distinctive enough to be recognizable even without the accompanying text.

2. Wordmark version: This version should feature the brand name written in a unique and aesthetically pleasing font. The emphasis here is on typography and how the brand name is visually presented.

3. Combined version: This version should integrate the icon and wordmark, creating a cohesive and unified logo that symbolizes the brand in its entirety. This version is important for brand recognition and consistency across various platforms.

For themes, consider creating variations with different themes such as cosmic, monochrome, minimal, etc. This will allow for flexibility in using the logos across different contexts and visual styles. Cosmic theme could tie in well with the name "Quasar" and convey a sense of mystery and innovation.

Include transparent PNGs and SVGs for each logo variation. Transparent PNGs are useful for web and digital applications, while SVGs are scalable and can be easily resized without losing quality. Providing both formats ensures versatility and compatibility with various design software and platforms.

Instructions for the system generating the brand:
1. Develop three logo variations: icon-only, wordmark, and combined version.
2. Explore different themes like cosmic, monochrome, minimal, etc.
3. Provide transparent PNG and SVG formats for each variation.
4. Ensure that the design is modern, sleek, and aligns with the futuristic and innovative brand identity of Quasar.
5. Aim for a balance between creativity and simplicity to ensure easy recognition and scalability of the logo across different mediums.
